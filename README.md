# Build a Tutorial

## Start Here ⬇️

1. Fork this repo.
2. Duplicate the [project_name] template folder.
3. Create a new branch (and work in this branch) called `tutorial-[your_github_username]` e.g. `tutorial-shreythecray`.
4. Rename the folder.
5. Update blog.md with a step-by-step guide on how to build your project.
6. Make a pull request to the original repo with your updates.

### Must Haves
* Breakdown your project build into 3-5 parts.
* Breakdown your code into small, consumable snippets and explain as much as you can.
* Protect your secret keys and info!
* Include screenshots of your project at different steps.

### Recommendations
* Keep your audience in mind throughout.
* Maintain a storyline.
* Use visuals to help the reader follow along (but not too many).
  * Gifs are always really easy to follow.
* Ask a friend to follow along and see where they get stuck - you might need to add more context there.

### Examples
- [Sending Secret Messages with the Courier API](https://github.com/shreythecray/secret-messages)
- [Build a Serverless Lie Detector that uses AI for Facial Recognition](https://github.com/shreythecray/lie-detector)
- [Infiltrate a Discord Server with Automated Encrypted Messages with Node.js](https://github.com/shreythecray/infiltration)

## Next Steps
All PRs will be reviewed and may be edited by the Courier team before being merged.

The Courier team will make sure that your tutorial is easy to follow and will attempt to build out the project first. We will request changes for issues that we cannot fix.
